## Introduction
This project aim was to develop a method to identify humans moving in front of a fixed camera without using Deep Learning methods. In order to make such think possible, we had to work extensively with "classical techniques" from OpenCV.

We will consider our project having, as input, the list of images here we want to find humans, and as output, an array of shape (n
